# 0x01. Python - Async

## Description
This project focuses on asynchronous programming in Python using the `asyncio` library. You will learn how to write and execute asynchronous programs, manage concurrent coroutines, and work with `async` and `await` syntax. Additionally, you'll explore creating asyncio tasks and utilize the `random` module for generating random values.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without external references:
- The `async` and `await` syntax
- How to execute an asynchronous program with `asyncio`
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create `asyncio` tasks
- How to use the `random` module

## Project Requirements
- You must create a `README.md` file at the root of the project.
- Your code must be written in Python 3.7 and interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
- All your files must:
  - End with a new line.
  - Be executable.
  - Follow the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.x).
  - Contain type annotations for all functions and coroutines.
  - Have documentation for modules and functions explaining their purpose (not just one word).
  - Use the `#!/usr/bin/env python3` shebang on the first line.


## Task Summary
- Implement asynchronous functions using `async` and `await`.
- Execute these functions using the `asyncio` library.
- Manage concurrent coroutines and tasks efficiently.
- Use the `random` module to generate random values within specific ranges.

## Requirements for Submission
- Ensure all files follow the project requirements mentioned above.
- Use `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs` to edit your files.
- Check the length of your files using `wc`.
- Submit your project by **Oct 15, 2024, 6:00 AM**.

## Compilation & Testing
- Use the following command to ensure your code is executable and follows the guidelines:
  ```bash
  chmod +x <filename.py>
