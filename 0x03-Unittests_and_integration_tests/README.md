# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

This project focuses on implementing unit tests and integration tests for a Python application. It aims to enhance code quality and ensure that individual functions and their interactions perform as expected.

## Project Overview

### Unit Tests
- **Definition**: Unit testing is the process of testing individual functions to ensure they return expected results for various inputs, including standard inputs and corner cases.
- **Purpose**: To confirm that each function works as intended when isolated from external dependencies (such as network or database calls).

### Integration Tests
- **Definition**: Integration testing aims to validate the end-to-end functionality of the application by testing interactions between different parts of the codebase.
- **Purpose**: To ensure that the integrated components work together correctly, especially those that make external calls.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain the differences between unit tests and integration tests.
- Understand common testing patterns, including mocking, parameterizations, and fixtures.
