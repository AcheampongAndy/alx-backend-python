# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

## Description
This project focuses on understanding asynchronous programming in Python, specifically using **asynchronous comprehensions** and **generators**. By the end of this project, you will know how to write asynchronous generators, use async comprehensions, and type-annotate generators in Python.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:

- How to write an asynchronous generator
- How to use async comprehensions
- How to type-annotate generators

## Requirements
### General
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** using **python3** (version 3.7).
- Code must follow the **pycodestyle** (version 2.5.x) coding style.
- The first line of all files should be: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- All files should end with a new line.
- Files must be tested for length using `wc`.
- All modules and functions should include proper documentation explaining their purpose.
- All functions and coroutines must be **type-annotated**.

### Project Constraints
- You must use `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs` as your editor.
- The project has a **24-hour deadline** from Oct 15, 2024, 6:00 AM to Oct 16, 2024, 6:00 AM.
- An **auto review** will be launched at the deadline.

## Project Structure
This project consists of the following key components:

- **Asynchronous Generators:** A way to create asynchronous data streams using `async def` and `yield`.
- **Async Comprehensions:** A way to iterate over asynchronous generators using `async for` within comprehensions.
- **Type Annotations for Generators:** Applying type hints to asynchronous generators to ensure type safety and code clarity.
