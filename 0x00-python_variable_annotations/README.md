# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations

## Overview
This project focuses on the use of **type annotations** in Python 3, which allow for specifying the types of variables and function parameters. You will also learn about **duck typing** and how to use **mypy** to validate your type annotations.

## Concepts Covered
- **Type annotations**: Defining variable and function types explicitly.
- **Duck typing**: Using objects based on their behavior rather than their actual type.
- **Mypy**: A static type checker for Python that verifies type consistency.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
1. Understand and explain type annotations in Python 3.
2. Use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types.
3. Explain and apply duck typing.
4. Validate Python code using `mypy`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 must be used (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS).
- All files must end with a new line.
- Your code should follow the **pycodestyle** style guide (version 2.5).
- Each module, class, and function must include proper documentation.
- All scripts must be executable (`chmod +x`).

## Setup Instructions
1. Ensure Python 3.7 is installed on your system.
2. Install **mypy** if not already installed:
